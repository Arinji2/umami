# **Umami - Enhanced Event Tracking Fork**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c62c32fd-e4d9-4896-8bae-077b0131427b)

I love Umami, but I wasn't a fan of how events were displayed for a specific session.  

### **Why This Fork?**  
Umami's default event tracking shows events per session, but I wanted a **story-like view** of user interactions—  
a way to **see everything a user does on my site in one place**.  

### **What's Different?**  
- Added an **API route** to fetch detailed event data (Umami doesn’t expose this by default).  
- Custom events now show **all their properties**, making it easier to track interactions.  

### **How to Use**  
You can run this fork using the prebuilt Docker image:  

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/arinji2/umami:latest
```

Or check out the package here:  
➡ **[GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/Arinji2/umami/pkgs/container/umami)**  

### **Branch Info**  
- **`detailed-edits`** → Contains all the modifications.  
- **`main`** → Kept empty to act as a gateway for easy updates from the original repo.
